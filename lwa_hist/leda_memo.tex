\title{LEDA Memo: 8 Bit Sampling of LWA Data}
\date{}
\author{Terry Filiba}
\maketitle

In order to determine the suitability of an 8 bit ADC for sampling LWA data, we analyzed data taken every 15 minutes over a 24 hour period from 6 LWA dual pol stands. The data was captured using the currently available 12 bit ADCs.

Initial analysis of the data showed that at least 97\% of the samples lie within the range $[-128,128)$. Without adjusting any gains there would be $< 3\%$ error using an 8 bit ADC.
If the ADC gain is set so that the RMS is $20$ the error rate of the ADC gets even lower. With the sampled data rescaled, saturation only occurs in $<0.001\%$ of the samples using an 8 bit ADC (an error rate of $10^{-5}$).

\input{table.tex}
\end{table}

Histogramming of the data shows that the majority of samples lie within 8 bits. 
The following pages contain plots of the data from each stand-pol. 
The blue bars highlight the samples that could be represented with 8 bits without gain adjustment. 
The yellow bars show the samples that would not saturate if the gain was adjusted so that the RMS is $20$.
The log plots of the data emphasize the short tails in the histogram, showing that adjusting the gain will be an effective way to reduce the error rate.
